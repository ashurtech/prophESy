# Extension Testing Guide - v1.2.0

## üöÄ How to Test the Import/Export Commands

### Step 1: Start Extension Development Host
1. **In this VS Code window**, press `F5` (or go to Run > Start Debugging)
2. This will open a **new VS Code window** titled "Extension Development Host"
3. Wait for the extension to load (you should see "statuESK" in the explorer)

### Step 2: Test Export Command
1. **In the Extension Development Host window**:
   - Open Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type: "Export Clusters"
   - You should see: "ESExt: Export Clusters"
   - Select it to test

### Step 3: Test Import Command
1. **In the Extension Development Host window**:
   - Open Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type: "Import Clusters" 
   - You should see: "ESExt: Import Clusters"
   - Select it to test

### Step 4: Test Context Menu
1. **In the Extension Development Host window**:
   - Look for the "statuESK" view in the Explorer panel
   - Right-click on the view title bar
   - You should see "Export Clusters" and "Import Clusters" options

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### Export:
- If you have clusters configured: Opens save dialog
- If no clusters: Shows message "No clusters to export"

### Import:
- Opens file picker dialog
- Accepts JSON files with cluster configurations
- Handles duplicates with user prompts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**If commands still not found:**
1. Close the Extension Development Host window
2. In the main window, press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Run "Developer: Reload Window"
4. Press `F5` again to restart debugging

**To see debug output:**
- In Extension Development Host: Help > Toggle Developer Tools
- Check Console tab for any error messages

## üìù Testing the Enhanced Cluster Info

1. Add an Elasticsearch cluster in the Extension Development Host
2. Connect to the cluster
3. Expand the cluster in the tree view
4. Click "Cluster Info"
5. You should see the enhanced display with:
   - Node counts and shard information
   - Color-coded status indicators (green/yellow/red)
   - Format: "X nodes total, Y data nodes, Z / limit shards - percentage%"

**Note**: Always test in the Extension Development Host window, not the main development window!
